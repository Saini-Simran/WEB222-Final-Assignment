			<h3>History</h3>
			<img src="./images/chaturanga.png" alt="Chaturanga" />
			<p>
				Chess is a strategic board game that originated in northern India in the
				6th century AD. The game was called chaturanga and was played with
				pieces representing four different branches of the Indian army:
				elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chaturanga spread to Persia and then to the Arab world, where it evolved
				into a game called shatranj. The pieces were renamed and modified to
				reflect Islamic culture: the elephants became bishops, the chariots
				became rooks, and the foot soldiers became pawns.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shatranj became a popular game throughout the Islamic world and was
				introduced to Europe via Spain in the 10th century. The Europeans
				modified the game further, changing the moves of some pieces and
				introducing new ones, such as the queen and the bishop.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the 15th century, chess had become the game we know today, with its
				modern pieces, moves, and rules. It quickly became a popular pastime
				among the European nobility and was played in courts and salons across
				the continent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over time, chess has become a global game, played by millions of people
				of all ages and backgrounds. It has also become the subject of research
				in various fields, including mathematics, psychology, and artificial
				intelligence.

			<h3>Rules</h3>
			<img src="./images/chess.webp" alt="" />
			<p>
				The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. Checkmate is
				a threat (check) to the opposing king that the defending player cannot
				prevent. The game ends when checkmate is delivered or when a player
				resigns.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game is played on a chessboard, a square board with 64 squares
				arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Each player begins the game with 16
				pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and
				eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently.
			</p>
			<p>
				The king moves one square in any direction. The queen combines the power
				of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank,
				file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces. The rook moves any
				number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other
				pieces. The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally, but cannot
				leap over other pieces. The knight moves to any of the closest squares
				that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an
				"L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two
				squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only
				piece that can leap over other pieces. The pawn may move forward to the
				unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its
				first move it may advance two squares along the same file, provided both
				squares are unoccupied; or the pawn may move to a square occupied by an
				opponent's piece which is diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file,
				capturing that piece. A pawn has two special moves: the en passant
				capture and promotion.
			</p>
			<p>
				A player may not make any move that would place or leave his king in
				check (threatened with capture). If a player is in check, there are only
				two ways to get out of check: (1) block the check with one of his own
				pieces, or (2) capture the attacking piece. If a player is unable to
				move out of check, he is checkmated, and the game ends.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game ends in a draw in several ways. If the player to move is not in
				check but has no legal move, the game is a stalemate. If both players
				agree to a draw, the game is a draw. If neither player has sufficient
				mating material (e.g., king and bishop vs. king and knight, or king and
				bishop vs. king and bishop with both bishops on squares of the same
				color), the game is a draw. If the same position occurs three times (not
				necessarily with the same player to move each time), the game is
				automatically drawn. If a player resigns, the game is over, and his
				opponent wins.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rules of chess are governed by the FIDE Laws of Chess. The rules are
				also summarized in the FIDE Handbook.

			<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
			<img src="./images/chess2.webp" alt="" />
			<p>
				Control the center: Try to control the center of the board with your
				pawns and pieces, as this gives you more space to maneuver and attack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Develop your pieces: Move your pieces out of their starting positions as
				soon as possible. This will give you more options for attacking and
				defending.
			</p>
            <p>
                Castle early: Castle your king to safety as soon as possible, as this protects your king and allows your rook to become more active.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think ahead: Try to anticipate your opponent's moves and plan your responses in advance, as this gives you more control over the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Watch for threats: Be aware of potential threats to your pieces and king, such as forks, pins, and skewers, and try to avoid or counter them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use tactics: Look for opportunities to use tactics such as forks, pins, skewers, and sacrifices to gain an advantage or create threats.

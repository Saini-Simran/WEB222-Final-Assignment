			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Hi! I am Simran. I’m a computer programming student at Seneca College. Though I didn’t have any programming background, I only learned everything from Seneca. I can work with C, C++, SQL, PL\SQL, MQL, HTML, and JAVA programming languages. I have also learned to work with Linux operating systems apart from Windows. In my journey of learning web languages, I have built three websites as my assignments in this course. I believe programming is a never-ending journey and never wants to end it. I’ll constantly learn more after finishing my program at Seneca

			<h1>Why I chose Chess</h1>
			<p>
				When I got to know about choosing a non-electric game for this final website assignment. I thought to work on my favorite game which is Chess. It is my favorite because I use to play it with my mother. She taught me, she played with me. Moreover, chess is an everlasting game, and finding content for it is not that tough.
